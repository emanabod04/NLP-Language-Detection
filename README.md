# NLP-Language-Detection
## Problem Formulation
With so many languages spoken and utilized around the world, it is 
difficult to master all of them to thrive in a new area. As a result, a 
translator is useful since it converts the required information to the target 
language. This simplifies our work because we only need a system to 
help us and do not need to know the target language.
Using the text, we must build a system that can predict the supplied 
language. Many artificial intelligence applications and computational 
linguists will benefit from this solution. This kind of prediction systems 
are commonly employed in electronic devices such as mobile phones, 
laptop computers, and so on for machine translation, as well as on robots. 
It also aids in the tracking and identification of multilingual papers



## Conclusion and Champion Model:
Ã˜ We choose the SVC model as the champion model because 
from the outcomes of the over-fitting and error analysis we 
found that it is the best
